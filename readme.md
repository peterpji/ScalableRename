# Yet another unit naming mod
This mod is for game Supreme Commander Forced Alliance and meant to be used with FA Forever community project.
It is based on "Veterename" by Cobrand (Published here: https://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=11382).

It aims to expand on existing mod by:
* Make unit name list easily expandable.
* Edit naming rules
    * Adjustable naming frequency
    * Adjust which units get names
    * Edit naming pools

## Ideas
* Exclude some units
    * Inties, asf
    * Structures?
* XP reserved to top donors, otherwise everyone on the same level
* Not too frequent naming
    * Logarithmic name frequency?
    * Specific to tier?
    * Separate land, air and navy?
